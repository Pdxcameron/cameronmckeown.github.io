	&ldquo;He was not Joaquin then, but Henry.  He was riding express from Walla Walla to Orofino, in the Nez Pearce [sic] mining country.  He rode on horseback, carried letters and small packages, and was as picturesque in person as a Spanish bandit.  There was no better rider anywhere at that time.  This little express line belonged to Miller and Mossman, and Miller was the solitary horseman, wearing his dark hair long; bright eyed, alert, active in movement, and a great talker.  He afterward came to be called eccentric.  We called him a &lsquo;little flighty&rsquo;.  He submitted to considerable chaffing, never allowing his good nature to become ruffled.  When the little express route began to develop it was bought by the Wells-Fargo company people.  If he had written any poetry then we never knew of it.  He had, however, written some sketches for the Portland (Oregon) papers.<br>
	Miller . . . never talked . . . about his early life . . . He was like an Arab in his habits, likely without a moment&rsquo;s warning to fold his tent and silently steal away.&rdquo; [HGT]<br>

	&ldquo;I continued in the business previously mentioned until October, 1861, <br>
	when C. Hiner Miller, now known as Joaquin Miller met me at Walla Walla with a letter of introduction to me from his uncle, Colonel W. W. Chapman.  Miller wanted to join me in the express business.  He had one little pony, and $5 in cash, but he could ride well and was a hustler.  I had at that time 18 head of good saddle horses, so I gave him an interest in the business.  Soon after that the Salmon River mines were discovered, and I put Miller on the route from Lewiston to Florence City, in the Salmon River Mines, while I rode between Walla Walla, Lewiston and the Oro Fino.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;diggings&rsquo; at Florence proved to be very rich.  There was a great rush to them, and by December there were many hundreds of men in there at work, and gold dust was plentiful.  About the 10th of December I got Miller to change off with me one trip, and I went to Florence, while he went to Walla Walla . . . .</p>
<p>Miller and I were together until the spring of 1862, when he decided to quit the business to go to Port Orford, Oregon, and to be married.  He was to marry a lady known as Minnie Myrtle, but whose correct name was Minnie Dyer.  So I paid him $600 over and above his profits and presented him with a fine horse, saddled and bridled.  He went to Portland and from there to Port Orford, where he was married. . . .&rdquo;<br>
