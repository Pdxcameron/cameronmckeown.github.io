	&ldquo;Mr. Joaquin Miller once pointed out to us the scene of an old Indian fight, whereof he bears a reminder in one of his arms, somewhat troublesome in damp weather.  For a poet, and a philanthropist of  the Greeley school, he seems to have had a large number of &lsquo;scrimmages of this sort . . . . Though we had a minstrel at the festive board he harped not, neither did he sing.  He was apparently in low spirits at leaving his Sierras.  Crossing the alkali desert is also depressing - inclining even a poet to keep his mouth shut - but when we struck the grand Rocky range something in the poetic line was expected from him.  But he kept his place on the platform in sombre silence, smoking cigarettes under the shade of a huge Panama.  We suspected he was secretly wrestling with the Rocky Mountains, and that they were having rather the best of it.  But if our wild singer warbled not he wrote many autographs, triumphs of illegibility.  The motion of a train is not usually favorable to the production of elegant articles of this sort.&rdquo; <br>
