<p>Miller used pen names for some of his earliest submissions; Vindicator,<br>
	Miner, Skurb, and *** in his Shasta County period. He sometimes used Hine, Hiner, Henry, Nat, or Ned Miller as well as John Smith Jr., Niles Gaston, and De Weiver; his many other pen names included Cora, Pax, U Know Who, Ned Miller, Sierra, Cincinnatus, and C.H. Miller. In 1863 he was using other pen names: Agricola, Professor Bones and H*** in The Golden Era, the initials &quot;C.H.&quot; in his first book, and an article written for the Overland Monthly; &quot;Cincinnatus H.&quot; in his second book; and thereafter his better known pen name &quot;Joaquin.&quot;</p>
<p> Many of Miller's early books published in the United States had previous publication, ranging from a few days to several months, in London.<br>
	<br>
	Entries are ordered chronologically with the following variances:</p>
<ul>
	<li> If a date is unknown or presumed, it is followed by a question mark (1881?).</li>
	<li>Books and other annual publications precede listings that include month and day.</li>
	<li>All publications sharing the same date are listed alphabetically by title.</li>
	<li>Untitled works precede titled works.</li>
	<li>Multiple articles in the same publication are listed in page order.</li>
	<li>Entries which span multiple years are at the end of the first year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following notations are being used with the knowledge that, although we have listed libraries or institutions where we know these books, materials etc. may be found, this list is not all-inclusive and many can be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>We also believe that- after thirty years of research - it was important for this material to be presented, notwithstanding the fact that certain citations have not been either seen or verified. There is much more to be found and many more newspaper articles to be identified as Miller's. For example, researchers are now identifying articles written but not signed by his fellow journalist Ambrose Bierce.</p>
