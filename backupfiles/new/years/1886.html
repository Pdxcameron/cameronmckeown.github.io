	Company with a manuscript to sell and a story of being a failed and penniless actress.  She was loaned money and put in the care of kind-hearted ladies who put her abroad a New York train.  And, the story doesn&rsquo;t end with her boarding of the train, other articles followed in the New York Times and various Chicago papers] [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s Daughter:  A Runaway Match Which Turned Her Father&rsquo;s Heart From <br>
	Her.&rdquo;  New York Times (19 January 1886):  8. <br>
	Opening with a summary of the previous day&rsquo;s article on Maud&rsquo;s troubles, the reporter goes on to quote from and summarize an article of Joaquin&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Women of the American Stage&rdquo; which appeared in the Chicago Times on Sunday) in which Joaquin urges men to be fathers and brothers and support young actresses.  This reporter then refers to another article in a different Chicago paper that stressed the contradiction of Miller writing the Times article and not supporting Maud in her time of need.</p>
<p>What follows this summary is the reporter&rsquo;s version of an interview he had the previous day at Miller&rsquo;s house in New York (he even supplies the address - No. 11 East 29th Street).  Mrs. Miller, her mother, Mrs. William W. Leland and a young girl [probably Juanita] were present.  The reporter assures readers that Mrs. Miller urged him to talk with Joaquin who had left during the middle of the previous week for Mexico via Washington.  However, he managed to persuade Mrs. Miller to provide details worthy of several paragraphs.</p>
<p>The details included Maud&rsquo;s schooling in Canada (6 years) at a convent, her visit to her father (3 years ago) and her desire to go to Europe being supported and funded by her father.  Then Maud&rsquo;s letter came.  She wanted to marry Mr. Steele Mackaye.  Father writes forbids marriage and writes for her to come home - the reward:  trip with him to New Orleans.  Daughter returns to the States and immediately goes to the Mackaye residence in New Jersey and marries the actor/author.  Doesn&rsquo;t invite father. </p>
<p>Along with these details, Mrs. Leland states that a telegram arrived yesterday and hadn&rsquo;t been opened.  The reporter provides this explanation: <br>
	&ldquo;Mrs. Joaquin Miller said yesterday that her husband never receives a telegram from anybody.  Some years ago he was greatly shocked by a messenger suddenly breaking in upon him with a telegraphic message announcing the death of his mother.  Since then he has never opened a telegram, and will not break the seal of a letter until he is through with his work and his mind is perfectly free from the cares of thought and work.&rdquo;<br>

My grandfather fell in the battle near old Fort Meigs, and is buried there.  I would, therefore, if for no other reason, be a sad patriot if I did not turn my back fondly to the banks of the great lakes of the North.  But a man&rsquo;s future is not behind him.  The dead past must bury its dead in the battle of life if we hope to carry the banner of our civilization forward.
