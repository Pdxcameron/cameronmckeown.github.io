	&ldquo;This is a work of preternatural silliness.  It has a rambling plot, absurd characters, and grotesque imagination.

	&ldquo;Highly laudatory Review comparing Miller&rsquo;s poetry to that of Emerson, Poe, Whitman, Longfellow and Whittier.  Ranks him &lsquo;next to Whitman among American poets&rsquo; and above Poe, and far superior to the others.  He has strength and depth of imagination, a &lsquo;Titanic fiery energy,&rsquo; a richness and freshness of description, and &lsquo;a noble hatred for everything base.&rsquo;&rdquo;  [RCL 28]<br>

	&ldquo;Review of The Ship in the Desert.  The story is unintelligible and uninteresting, though it displays Miller&rsquo;s usual vivid imagination and feverish style.  His English critics have been impressed by his display of &lsquo;the roughness of the backwoods,&rsquo; but to us this is mere coarseness, vulgarity, and barbarism.&rdquo;  [RCL 30]<br>

	&ldquo;One is surprised at the skill in plot construction and the cleverness in depicting Italian life.  At times Miller comes close to combining Longfellow&rsquo;s grace and Holmes&rsquo;s wit.
