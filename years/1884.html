	&ldquo;Standard biographical information - Joaquin&rsquo;s birth, editorship, judgeship, divorce and courtship.  Also provides a critical Review of his work overall.  Unlike many other sources, this text states that Miller was &lsquo;the Paris correspondent of a leading New York Paper during the Franco-German War.&rsquo;&rdquo; [MCK] [HGT]<br>

	&ldquo;Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s Suit.&rdquo;  New York Times (13 February 1884):  8.<br>
	Note that Miller (represented by Simon Sterne and A. Regensberg), with McKee Rankin (represented by Howe &amp; Hummel) opposite him, sat before Judge Lawrence in the Supreme Court, Special Term the previous afternoon.  The reporter discusses what Joaquin alleges in his complaint and that he is seeking $5,000 in damages and an injunction stopping Rankin from playing &ldquo;49&rdquo;.  A brief overview of the defense follows along with the comment that the Court was occupied mainly with reading text from Miller&rsquo;s work and text from a report that a court reporter had recorded from the play. [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;Festivities at the Capital.&rdquo;  New York Times (24 February 1884):  1.<br>
	Mrs. Joaquin Miller attended a large reception given by Mrs. McElroy at the <br>
	White House during the afternoon.  Many of the attendees were wives of <br>
	prominent army officers and senators.  These women are listed and their dress described. [MCK]<br>

	&ldquo;A Man About Town.&rdquo;  New York Times (30 March 1884): 6. [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;Speaking of Harte, I am reminded that the suit which Joaquin Miller desired him <br>
	to bring against McKee Rankin for an invasion of dramatic copyright of &lsquo;Gabriel Conroy&rsquo; has come to naught.  The poet of the Sierras wrote a furious letter to Harte warning him of this high-handed outrage, and Harte, being duly worked up to a proper pitch of indignation, probably believed that he was being wronged.  So he answered Miller&rsquo;s letter in terms quite as warm as those employed by the poet, and he instructed his next friend to protect his rights.  It turns out, however, that William S. Andrews is the owner of the dramatic version of Harte&rsquo;s novel, and that he bought the right to dramatize the story from the Hartford publishers of &lsquo;Gabriel Conroy,&rsquo; and that the publishers bought all rights, the dramatic copyright included, from Mr. Harte.  This little story shows how easy it is for a man to be wrought up to such a pitch of indignation that he can forget what are his real rights and what his imaginary ones&rdquo; [MCK]<br>

	Campbell, Bartley. My Partner.  A play produced at the Olympic Theatre in London, April 10-May8.  [I saw the play delivered as a farce by the Western Literature Association (WLA) Reader&rsquo;s Theatre in Estes Park, Colorado, October 3, 1991, and there was not a line, scene, or situation that couldn&rsquo;t have been found somewhere in Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s works.  Some reviews suggest Campbell took suggestions from the works of Bret Harte and Joaquin Miller.  A German version with the title, Mein Kumpan, was staged in Berlin in 1883 and at Bomberg in 1884.  A moving picture version was filmed in 1909.]  [Miller knew Frank Campbell, Bartley&rsquo;s brother in Siskiyou Co. in 1854] [MGK]<br>
