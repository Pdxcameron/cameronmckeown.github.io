	&ldquo;Mrs. M. Miller is at present engaged in canvassing for this book.  While we do not comment the book, we are anxious that everybody should buy it, as by its sale the lawful mother of &ldquo;Joaquin&rdquo; Miller&rsquo;s children hopes to earn bread for her dependent family.  She is a lady of refinement and intelligence.  Her heart is growing strong under its burdens and we predict that the day is not far-distant when she will be able to prove that she can become more deservedly famous than the pampered &lsquo;Judge&rsquo; who deserted his wife and children in the hour of their sorest need.  Buy the book, ye men who have money, and enable &ldquo;Joaquin&rsquo;s&rdquo; family to live.&rdquo;<br>

	&ldquo;Believes that Miller resembles Browning in his novel metaphors and in	 his humor, but he is no copyist.

	&ldquo;Praises Songs of the Sierras &lsquo;as the work of an admirable poet of whom America may be proud.  While Miller bears a considerable relationship to Byron in his romantic narrative fancy and brooding melancholy, he has actually experienced his semicivilized adventure.  There are faulty lines, platitudes of phrase, and inadmissible words, but these are minor flaws compared to his ability to interfuse external nature and the human soul in his descriptive passages, and the excitement and ambition of his poetical genius.&rsquo;&rdquo; [RCL 21]<br>

	&ldquo;A Few Facts About Joaquin Miller.&rdquo;  New Northwest (Portland, Oregon) (28 July 1871): 1.  [MUL micro] [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;Mr. Joaquin Miller, the Oregon poet, formerly of Grant County, has struck a lead in London with his Songs of the Sierras.  He is reported to be the latest pet of the best critical and poetical authorship of the town; the associate of the Rossettis, of Morris, of Jean Ingelow, and others.  The principal papers have given him laudatory criticism; and Froude, the historian; Swinburne and Rossetti are to do that office for him in some other leading Reviews&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>
	&ldquo;The Poet Miller.&rdquo;  Daily Oregon Herald (29 July 1871)  [MUL Micro] [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;The New Northwest speaks of Cincinnatus H. Miller, alias Joaquin Miller, as &lsquo;a truant husband . . . &rsquo;  This sounds harshly, but it has the semblance of truth.  Miller went from Oregon with about eight thousand dollars of gold, leaving behind him his divorced wife and babes, who were found afterwards in this city - almost destitute, struggling bravely against poverty - to whom several gentlemen of Portland provided for in their need, as the natural husband and father should have done.  It may be indeed a question whether a man so lacking in the love for his own wife and children, which is supposed God has implanted in every human heart, can ever become a real poet.  It is indeed claimed by some that Miller has received most of his poetical cultivation from his wife, who has written really finer poems than ever Miller produced.&rdquo;&hellip;&rdquo;The editor of the Eugene Journal, writing to the Washington Chronicle concerning Miller says: &ldquo;Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s &ndash; &ldquo; &lsquo;Sacrifice Impetro&rsquo; [in answer to Miller&rsquo;s Myrrh]- was published in the Daily Herald of June 16th, 1870, and was really a finer poem than Miller himself ever wrote.  In this poem Mrs. Miller alluded to the circumstances narrated,,,&rdquo; in this article. [A reprint of the poem then follows] [MCK] <br>

	<br>
	During the time that he was connected with the Register, he published one or more serial stories under his own name and called them original.  They were, however, stolen bodily from some of the flash publications of that day.  The plagiarism was palpable and audacious.  For particulars, we refer the curious to the files of the paper named, of, if we mistake not, the year 1862, in the Librarian&rsquo;s office at Salem&hellip;. Poets are only a little lower than the angels.  No such base metal as this Charles Heiner Miller ever gave out the true poetic ring.  He is simply gifted with rare impudence.  He is only a compound of brass and bad grammar.  If his be fame, then what is fame worth?&rdquo; - Albany Democrat<br>

	&ldquo;While there is something excellent in &lsquo;The Arazonian,&rsquo; most of Miller&rsquo;s poetry is puerile and bedlamite, and his style and versification are faulty.

	&ldquo;The Golden City, the leading literary journal of San Francisco, has the following severe paragraph about &lsquo;Joaquin&rsquo; Miller, which is in decided contrast to some of the fulsome flattery bestowed upon him in the East: <br>
	&lsquo;Joaquin Miller, the rhyming rhapsodist, is still in this city - lionized by a few SOI DISTANT poets, impecunious Bohemians and gunny-bag aristocrats.&rsquo;&rdquo; <br>
	&ldquo;An Erratic Sham.&rdquo;  New Northwest (Portland, Oregon) (17 November 1871)  [OHS micro] [MCK]<br>
	&ldquo;The Oregonian thinks that we, with unnecessary severity, &lsquo;characterize&rsquo; &lsquo;Joaquin Miller&rsquo; as an &lsquo;erratic sham.&rsquo; Has the Oregonian forgotten that it, as well as the other dailies of this city, indorsed all that we said of &lsquo;Joaquin&rsquo; while the Atlantic Ocean lay between them and himself?  And will that journal, now that this new literary donkey is braying right in our very faces, grow frightened and applaud?</p>
<p>We have never said &lsquo;Joaquin&rsquo; Miller was not a poet, but we do say, with the Bulletin, that he is not a man; and if our friend of the Oregonian has any fear that we have overstated the case, let him read Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s letter as it appears in his paper, and satisfy himself that we have not been &lsquo;unnecessarily severe.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
